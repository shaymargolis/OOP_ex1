=          Design           =
=============================
I implemented the classes according to the API's that were attached with the Exerice.
The Patron and Book classes represents patron and book, and the Library is the manager
that can assign books to patrons, add patron and books.



=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
In the Patron class, I added a function that calculated the enjoyment of a Patron from a book.
In the library class, I added 2 java arrays, one for the patrons in the library and one for
the books in the library. both the arrays are in the length of the maxCapacity for each type (
given in the Constructor), filled with nulls and the new books/patrons are assigned in the end
of the array.
